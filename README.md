# Releave

Releave is a crowd-sourced application for finding public restrooms. Its purpose is to alleviate the stress involved in
finding a restroom in a crowded city. Restroom information will include:

- Location
- Name of establishment
- Average user rating
- Whether or not the restroom requires a key/code
- Whether or not the restroom is single-occupant

Some of this information will be available for free, while the rest will be available only to users with premium
accounts.

This application interacts with the [Releave API](https://github.com/hmmelton/Releave-Api/).
